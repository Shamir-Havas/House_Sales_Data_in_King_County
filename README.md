<b>🏡 House Price Prediction – King County</b>

This project explores house sales data from King County, USA, applying data science techniques to analyze housing trends and build predictive models. It demonstrates my skills in exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning—essential tools for real-world data science.

<b>🚀 Project Highlights</b>

Data Wrangling & Cleaning – handled missing values, transformed data types, and prepared the dataset for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – discovered patterns in price distribution, correlations with location, bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage.

Data Visualization – used plots to showcase price trends, outlier detection, and feature importance.

Feature Engineering – created new features (e.g., age of house, renovated flag) to improve model performance.

Machine Learning – applied regression models to predict housing prices and evaluated performance with metrics like RMSE and R².

Actionable Insights – identified key drivers of house prices that could guide buyers, sellers, and policymakers.
